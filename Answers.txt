1. The QuestionOne class implements a linear search algorithm and the InterpolationSearch class implements interpolation search.

2. As shown in the included screenshots, the run time for the linear algorithm was 4900 ns, and 531,800 ns for interpolation. 
Linear search performed better because there are only 10 numbers in the array. 
Interpolation would perform better than linear, as the numbers in the array increase.

3. The runtime of the linear search was decreased by 22% by using a recursive approach.
